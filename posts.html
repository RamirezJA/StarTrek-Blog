          These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing
          mission, to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new
          civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before. We need to
          neutralize the homing signal. Each unit has total environmental
          control, gravity, temperature, atmosphere, light, in a protective
          field. Sensors show energy readings in your area. We had a forced
          chamber explosion in the resonator coil. Field strength has increased
          by 3,000 percent.
        </p>

        <p>
          Run a manual sweep of anomalous airborne or electromagnetic readings.
          Radiation levels in our atmosphere have increased by 3,000 percent.
          Electromagnetic and subspace wave fronts approaching synchronization.
          What is the strength of the ship's deflector shields at maximum
          output? The wormhole's size and short period would make this a local
          phenomenon. Do you have sufficient data to compile a holographic
          simulation?
        </p>

        <p>
          Deflector power at maximum. Energy discharge in six seconds. Warp
          reactor core primary coolant failure. Fluctuate phaser resonance
          frequencies. Resistance is futile. Recommend we adjust shield
          harmonics to the upper EM band when proceeding. These appear to be
          some kind of power-wave-guide conduits which allow them to work
          collectively as they perform ship functions. Increase deflector
          modulation to upper frequency band.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sensors indicate no shuttle or other ships in this sector. According
          to coordinates, we have travelled 7,000 light years and are located
          near the system J-25. Tractor beam released, sir. Force field
          maintaining our hull integrity. Damage report? Sections 27, 28 and 29
          on decks four, five and six destroyed. Without our shields, at this
          range it is probable a photon detonation could destroy the Enterprise.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now what are the possibilities of warp drive? Cmdr Riker's nervous
          system has been invaded by an unknown microorganism. The organisms
          fuse to the nerve, intertwining at the molecular level. That's why the
          transporter's biofilters couldn't extract it. The vertex waves show a
          K-complex corresponding to an REM state. The engineering section's
          critical. Destruction is imminent. Their robes contain ultritium,
          highly explosive, virtually undetectable by your transporter.
